My dearest Shilah,

I’ve taken some time to think about everything that happened between us—every word, every silence, and every moment that led to us parting ways. And even now, after all of it, my heart still whispers your name.

I know we had disagreements and misunderstandings, and I acknowledge my part in all of it. Sometimes pride, miscommunication, and emotions get in the way of what truly matters—our love and connection. I regret the pain we caused each other, and if I could turn back time, I would have chosen understanding over anger and love over ego.

You were more than just my girlfriend—you were my safe space, my joy, my peace. And it hurts to realize how fragile something so beautiful became. But even in this distance, I want you to know that I still love you deeply. That hasn’t changed.

I miss your laugh, your voice, and the way you used to look at me. Most of all, I miss us—what we were, and what we could still be.

If there's even the slightest chance for us to talk, to understand each other again, and to rebuild—I’m here. I’m not perfect, but I’m willing to grow, to learn, and to fight for us.

Please remember: my love for you is still alive, and it’s real. I miss you, Shilah. I truly do.
